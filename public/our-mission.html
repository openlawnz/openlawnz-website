                            OpenLaw NZ is an open-source legal data platform. Our goal is to improve the
                            accessibility of case law and other legal information in New Zealand. We want to make it
                            easier for all New Zealanders to understand law.
                        </p>

                        <p>We founded OpenLaw NZ in 2018 as a non-profit charity in response to the lack of available
                            free legal research tools and data in New Zealand.</p>

                        <p>
                            Our platform is open source, and can be modified and used by any non-profit organisation
                            around the world to improve access to justice in their country.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="body-title">Our data</h2>
                        <p>Because case law is not subject to copyright restrictions, we have been able to re-purpose
                            PDFs of case law from the Ministry of Justice websites and convert them into usable pieces
                            of data that a computer can read and search. </p>
                        <p>
                            The case law data we have currently comprises High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court
                            decisions from present day back to approximately 2004 (with some exceptions, for example
                            some suppressed decisions and other judgments that have not been published), plus ACC appeal
                            decisions in the District Court.
                        </p>
                        <p>We look at those PDF files and analyse them to see what pieces of information might be useful
                            – for example, references to pieces of legislation, dates, relationships and citations.
                            We’re always working on expanding the data we can extract. </p>

                        <p>We want to make legal information as accessible as we can.</p>

                        <p>That means our data is open and accessible to everybody. You can interact with our data
                            through our website and search. Or you can tap directly into our database through our API.
                            All of our code is open source and licensed to the public under the GPL open source license.
                        </p>

                        <p>Because we are a charity and have limited resources, access to our database and API is only
                            for non-commercial purposes. This lets us make sure that our data isn’t copied by a
                            commercial provider and locked away behind a paywall. If you need access to our data for
                            commercial purposes but consider your use will still benefit the public by enhancing the
                            accessibility of legal information, we will consider it – please get in touch. </p>
