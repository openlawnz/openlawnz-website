								OpenLaw NZ Receives Law Foundation Grant
							</h2>
							<p class="blog-meta">2019-10-19</p>
							<p>
								The New Zealand Law Foundation has funded a joint project between OpenLaw NZ and
								researchers Tom Barraclough, Curtis Barnes and Warren Forster to apply automated
								technologies and analytics to case law to enhance access to justice.
							</p>
							<p>
								The core goal of the project is to develop automated tools that greatly reduce the time
								and expertise necessary to conduct legal research, both academic and practical. In
								short, as an output of the project, learnings that once would have required a team of
								legal researchers working many hours will be attainable by laypersons in a fraction of
								the time.
							</p>
							<p>
								This information will be accessible to the public, allowing them to engage with case law
								far more extensively than is presently the case. The possibilities that flow from this
								would be a significant breakthrough in access to justice and the democratization of law.
							</p>

							<p>
								OpenLaw NZ's role will be to provide the technology and infrastructure, leveraging its
								existing open-source platform and expertise. Approximately 7,500 Court decisions about
								ACC cases will be used as the pilot dataset.
							</p>

							<h2 class="body-title">OpenLaw NZ launches new website</h2>
							<p class="blog-meta">2019-9-13</p>
							<p>
								With the help of our awesome volunteer team, today we launch our website redesign!
							</p>

							<p>
								The new website adds a much improved design and user interface. The site is also
								responsive, which makes it much easier to use on a mobile device. The search
								functionality has been upgraded to add pagination, and a new case display page.
							</p>
							<p>
								We've also been working behind the scenes with our case law API and data pipeline. We
								have upgraded the API technology (including a new interface that allows you to explore
								API queries), added automatic extraction of Court information, overhauled our case to
								legislation algorithm, and migrated our database from mySQL to PostgreSQL.
							</p>
							<p>
								All credit goes to our current volunteers: April Liau for the designs, Blaine Western
								leading the front end web team (including Caio Navarro, Tian Bai, and Hanbyul Son), our
								API expert Noel Soong, and our data parsing and devops volunteers Ed Haslam, Alex Chan,
								and Limei Wang.

								Amazing response to call for volunteers
							</h2>
							<p class="blog-meta">2019-9-13</p>
							<p>
								In July 2019, OpenLaw NZ put out a call for volunteers who would be interested in
								helping contribute to the platform. We sought front end web developers, people
								experienced with data parsing and machine learning, devops and infrastructure, design
								and law students or lawyers.
							</p>
							<p>
								The response has been fantastic. In three months, we've brought on a team of 20
								committed volunteers, each with a set of skills and experience that has been invaluable
								in building additional functionality.
